# Fof_Stuff
All the scripts assume that the fof file is in the same directory. Otherwise you can add the path infront of the filename wich is at the top.

- List_fof.py lists the structure of the hdf5 file as groups and datasets and whatnot.
- 
- HaloMass_fof.py plots the cumulative halo mass function.
