# Fof_Subhalo_Stuff
All the scripts assume that the fof file is in the same directory. Otherwise you can add the path infront of the filename wich is at the top.

A sample fof file is added in case you wanted to test the scripts.

- List_fof.py lists the structure of the hdf5 file as groups and datasets and whatnot.
- List_everything_fof.py will literally return all the values of the datasets and whatnot.
- HaloMass_fof.py plots the cumulative halo mass function.
- MaxVelProfile_fof.py plots the maximum velocity profile for the halos.
-ParticleDistribution_inside_halos.py plots the velocity of particles in a halo.
- ParticleDistribution_SIDM_State.py plots velocity of particles by SIDM type.
